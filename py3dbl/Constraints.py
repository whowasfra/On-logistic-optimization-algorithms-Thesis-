    Progressive Center-of-Gravity constraint.

    Checks that the CoG of the bin after placing the item stays within a
    tolerance zone around the bin centre on the X-Z plane.

    The constraint becomes **progressively stricter** as the bin fills up:
    at low load ratios the tolerance is at its configured maximum, and it
    shrinks linearly towards ``tol * (1 - progressive_tightening)`` when
    the bin is fully loaded.  This gives early items freedom to spread out
    while forcing later items to correct any imbalance.

    Additionally, a **corrective bias** is applied: when the current CoG
    deviates from the bin centre by more than half the effective tolerance,
    any placement that would *increase* that deviation is rejected.  This
    prevents the imbalance from growing once it becomes significant.
